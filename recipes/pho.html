    <h1><strong><em>Homemade Beef Pho</em></strong></h1>
    <img src="../pics/beefpho.jpeg">
    <p>I’ve been saving so much time at home ever since I started making my Short Cut Beef Pho. As much as I like to explore different recipes, pho will always end up on my dinner table at least once a week. Pho, a Vietnamese noodle soup, is loved by everyone in my household, and having a bowl of this comforting soup can be enjoyed in any weather. However, preparing the broth in traditional ways takes hours, so I found a way to make it in less than 20 minutes.</p>
    <p>I know that making pho can be intimidating for many people, and sometimes even finding the ingredients can be a challenge, but let me assure you that my Short Cut Beef Pho is simple and quick. You may have never used ingredients like rock sugar, fish sauce,  rice noodles, or hoisin sauce, so if you can’t find some of those ingredients at your local Asian market, just click those links to shop. Once you stock up on your pho ingredients, my Short Cut Beef Pho might end up on your dinner table every week too!</p>

    <h1><strong>Directions</strong></h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, add beef broth, onion, garlic, rock sugar, fish sauce and pinch of salt. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>While that boils, heat cinnamon stick, star anise, and fennel seeds to release natural oils. Add the spices to the broth. Simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>To prepare your bowl of pho, layer bean sprouts, Thai basil, green onion, and beef. While putting a strainer over the bowl, use a ladle to pour the broth over the bowl. The heat from the broth will cook the beef and the bean sprouts.</li>
