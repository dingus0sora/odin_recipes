    </ul>

    <h1><strong>Directions</strong></h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Place pork, salt, soy sauce, rice wine, sugar with the pork meat/mince in a large mixing bowl. Mix vigorously with a spoon or use your hands until it becomes pasty (initially it will be crumbly) - about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add mushrooms, prawns and green onions, mix until just dispersed (don't crush the prawn meat).</li>
        <li>Form an "O" with your forefinger and thumb.</li>
        <li>Place a wonton wrapper over the "O". Push in 1 heaped teaspoon of Filling and push down into the "O" hole.</li>
        <li>Use a butter knife to smear more Filling into until level with edge of wonton.</li>
        <li>Place on work surface and push down to flatten base and use fingers to shape into a round.</li>
        <li>Line a 30cm/12" bamboo steamer (or stove steamer) with baking paper with holes in it.</li>
        <li>Place Siu Mai in steamer (20 - 25 fits). Place lid on, place on wok over simmering water.</li>
        <li>Remove steamer from wok. Remove lid and place a tiny bit of roe in the middle of each dumpling.</li>
    </ol>
